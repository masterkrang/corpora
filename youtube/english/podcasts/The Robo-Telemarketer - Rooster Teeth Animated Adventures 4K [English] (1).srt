Burnie: But, I had a crazy thing

3
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:11,048
I thought of you as soon as I had this conversation Gus.

4
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:12,090
I was in my car

5
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:14,073
and I got a phone call, and it was from, like Las Vegas, Nevada

6
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:18,102
I'm like, "I don't know anybody in fucking Las Vegas. Ah, fuck it, I'll answer it."

7
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:22,040
So I answer my phone. There's a pause and then a woman comes on and she goes,

8
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:23,040
"Hello, is this Burnie Burns?"

9
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,081
and I said, "Yes it is".

10
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,058
and I immediately knew I was talking to a telemarketer

11
00:00:27,074 --> 00:00:28,080
because I know that pause means...

12
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:30,082
Gus: ...the call's being connected.

13
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:32,083
Burnie: Yeah. But she says, "Hello, is this Burnie Burns?" and I go, "Yes it is."

14
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:33,099
She goes, and this is exactly how she sounded,

15
00:00:34,062 --> 00:00:37,080
[robotically] "I'm calling today to talk to you about your vehicle

16
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:39,052
which may be eligible for a new extended warranty."

17
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:41,076
Burnie: And I was like, "Oh god, is this a computer?"

18
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:41,086
and she goes,

19
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:43,092
[normal voice] "Oh, do I sound that bad today?"

20
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:44,126
Burnie: and I was like, "Oh shit!"

21
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:46,120
[Gavin and Gus laughing]

22
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,009
Burnie: "I'm so sorry!" I said, "That must have been so insulting!"

23
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,031
I said, "I used to run call centers, anyway I apologize."

24
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:52,038
And just, she laughed, and she goes,

25
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:56,039
"Ok well the reason I'm calling is about the extended warranty on a vehicle

26
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:58,074
you might be qualified for an extended warranty."

27
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,078
Burnie: "I know what you're calling about, I get calls about this all the time.

28
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:03,038
It's my truck, I'm in the process of selling my truck.

29
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:05,062
So I don't want an extended warranty on it."

30
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:06,071
She goes, [robotic] "I'm sorry, you don't qualify"

31
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:08,124
Burnie: "Are you a computer?"

32
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:10,102
and she goes, "What makes you say that?"

33
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:12,070
Burnie: "You're not saying no."

34
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,172
she goes, "I guess I'm not."

35
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:14,166
[Gavin and Gus laughing incredulously]

36
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:18,132
Burnie: "Can you just answer the question, are you human or are you a computer?"

37
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:22,034
and she goes, "I'm sorry you don't qualify, thank you."

38
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:22,057
and hangs up

39
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,044
Gavin: "Oh my god! You don't even know!"

40
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:27,116
Burnie: I don't know if I talked to a computer or not!

41
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:30,030
and her first response was, "Do I sound that bad today",

42
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:32,056
She didn't say no, so it had that built in.

43
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,110
Gavin: So it's a smart robot. You got hung up on by a robot

44
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,009
Burnie: I know. I apologized to a robot, for being rude.

45
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,043
Like I'm sorry, you fucking metal hunk of junk.
