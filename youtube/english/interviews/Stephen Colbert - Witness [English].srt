STEPHEN COLBERT: Welcome to<i>
 The Report</i> everybody,

5
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,191
thank you so much for
joining us.

6
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:27,627
[applause and cheering]

7
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,434
Thank you so much.

00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:30,096
[applause and cheering]

00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:35,601
[Crowd chanting: Stephen!
Stephen! Stephen!]

10
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:37,837
Thank you so much ladies
and gentlemen.

11
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:38,822
FR. TOM: I'm overcome with
emotion, being here in

12
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:42,341
this chair, normally I can
handle this, but when I see

13
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:44,471
who's in front of me in this
particular episode of<i> WITNESS,</i>

14
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:47,013
I say,<i> "Mein Gott!"</i>

15
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:51,451
Or,<i> "Mama mia!"</i> Stephen Colbert
is with us, here on<i> WITNESS, </i>

16
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,852
so thank you for making
the time for us-

17
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:55,088
Watch your language Father,
this is a family show.

18
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,289
[Fr. Tom chuckles]

19
00:00:56,322 --> 00:01:00,827
Now, which Stephen Colbert is
sitting in the chair here?

20
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:01,254
COLBERT: You know-

21
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,363
FR. TOM: Is this Stephen Colbert
of<i> The Colbert Report? </i>

22
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:07,567
Or is this a new Stephen
Colbert? Are you born again?

23
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:11,244
COLBERT: Well- wow.
That's ambitious. Um-

24
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,539
That's a good question, because
when people invite me

25
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:15,975
to do things, I don't-

26
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,111
I don't always know who
they've invited,

27
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,246
me or the guy on the
television show.

28
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:21,047
So who are you?

29
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:23,210
COLBERT: This is me.
This is me.

30
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:26,018
FR. TOM: So this is like the
presentation of Stephen Colbert 

31
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:27,086
to the world.

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,187
Uh, yes.

33
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,058
FR. TOM: The new Stephen,
born again Stephen.

34
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,725
COLBERT: Um, yes, I mean
that- boy,

35
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:36,496
I- certainly out of his cocoon.

36
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,932
I changed my Twitter handle from
@stephencolbert, 

37
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:43,703
like host of<i> The Colbert Report,</i>
to @stephencolbertpolliwog, 

38
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,671
because after the last show
was over,

39
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:48,141
I felt like I went back to
a tadpole form.

40
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,408
You know, and I wanted to, 

41
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:52,478
I wanted to like lose my arms
and legs, and grow a tail 

42
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:55,148
and have a- you know, a fleshy
sac around me, 

43
00:01:55,181 --> 00:02:00,253
filled with amniotic fluid,
because I really do need to 

44
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,822
lose old habits from the old
show to the new show, 

45
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:06,759
so, yeah, born again, that
sounds great Father.

46
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,461
FR. TOM: Now before we bury you,

47
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:12,165
I am intrigued to look at that
previous character, 

48
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,333
because it's a character,
obviously that's captivated 

49
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,601
the imagination of the world-

50
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,170
Right, what do you want
to know about him Father?

51
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,504
Who's asking and why? Okay.

52
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:19,739
FR. TOM: I'm asking- This is-

53
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,641
Just because you got the dog
collar on doesn't mean

54
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,342
you know more about
the Catholic Church than I do,

55
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,977
you understand me?
Are we clear on that?

56
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:26,703
I learned a couple weeks ago
you know a hell of a lot

57
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:27,880
about the Catholic Church.

58
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:31,017
I know one or two things,
I'm not going to say I'm a-

59
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:32,440
a Basilian, you're a
Basilian right?

60
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:33,352
A Basilian, yeah.

61
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:34,320
COLBERT: St. Basil?

62
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:35,655
FR. TOM: We're many, Basilians.

63
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,789
COLBERT: Okay?
St. Basil?

64
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:37,623
FR. TOM: St. Basil.

65
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:38,824
COLBERT:
I'm no fan, okay?

66
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:39,926
FR. TOM: Why?

67
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,194
COLBERT: St. Arugula,
that's the saint.

68
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,228
FR. TOM: St. Arugula-

69
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:43,930
That's the saint I worship,
okay?

70
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,830
Delicious.

71
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:46,031
St. Arugula-

72
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:48,668
COLBERT: With a little St. Pine
Nut, little St. Reggiano-

73
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,936
Yeah, St. Grappa's lovely too.

74
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,971
COLBERT: St. Grappa,
I have worshipped.

75
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:53,239
[Fr. Tom laughing]

76
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:55,474
COLBERT: I have worshipped the
porcelain throne of St. Grappa.

77
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:56,275
[Fr. Tom laughing]

78
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:57,176
I haven't.

79
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,110
You haven't?

80
00:02:58,143 --> 00:02:59,779
Now tell me something, 

81
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,448
why is it my whole staff at
Salt + Light Television,

82
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:04,350
when they knew I was going to be
doing this interview, 

83
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:06,752
they went wild. They said,
"Father, 

84
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,854
this is bigger than anything
you've ever done, 

85
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,984
this is bigger than three popes
together!"

86
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,825
So I asked them, I said, "What
the heck's big about this?"

87
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,695
I watched some of those
programs, I mean it's- 

88
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,997
it's an incredible program that
he did, nine years-

89
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:18,771
COLBERT: Yeah. 

90
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,700
FR. TOM: -of<i> The Colbert Report.</i>

91
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,337
Who was that character? What
created that character?

92
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,206
COLBERT: That character
was, first of all, 

93
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:29,308
can I go back, you just said
bigger than three popes.

94
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,310
You can't be bigger than
three popes,

95
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:32,878
you can only be bigger
than two popes,

96
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,847
that's the most we've ever
had at one time.

97
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,423
Oh except during Avignon,
I guess,

98
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:37,650
there were three popes at
one point, right?

99
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:39,318
FR. TOM: That's right, what do
you think- I know my history.

100
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:41,398
COLBERT: Okay, I apologise.
Forgive me Father,

101
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,557
for I doubted you. Thank you
very much.

102
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:45,227
[Fr. Tom laughing]

103
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,562
That guy was, we like to
describe him as-

104
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:51,931
well he was a pundit,
first of all,

105
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:54,700
and pundits are creatures
of pure opinion,

106
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:58,004
not necessarily fact,
but feelings,

107
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,772
what they feel is true.

108
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:02,541
And we like to describe him as a

109
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:05,111
well-intentioned, which was
really important to me, 

110
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,151
well-intentioned, poorly
informed, not a very

111
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:11,584
curious person, high status,
in other words he

112
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:15,588
assumed the high ground on
every argument, idiot,

113
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:18,357
and the idiot 

114
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,116
is kind of the hardest part of
it because 

115
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:25,398
it sounds pejorative to say
"idiot", but idiocy is actually-

116
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,167
or foolishness is another way
to say it, a fool,

117
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,705
is really a hard thing to 

118
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,963
consistently achieve,
as a performer.

119
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,942
Like when we're rewriting any
show, whether it was my old show

120
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:38,982
or any show I've worked on,
as a comedian,

121
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,180
you'll be sitting around trying
to think of the right joke, 

122
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:43,916
and someone will say,
"Well I have an idea."

123
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,252
"What is it?" Because you're on
a deadline, 

124
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:49,021
the clock is ticking. And-
and the person will go,

125
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:51,357
"Well- oh I don't know,
it's stupid."

126
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,641
And we'd go, "How stupid?"

127
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,560
[laughing]

128
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:57,530
COLBERT: Because stupid
is like gold, because 

129
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,499
to think illogically is,
you know, is-

130
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:03,669
to think illogically is often
just to think unexpectedly, 

131
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:05,838
and we perceive it as stupid,
but that, you know, 

132
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:07,940
it's boring to talk about what
makes something funny, 

133
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,109
but that change up between
your expectation

134
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,239
and what somebody- the way
someone behaves, 

135
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:16,816
in a joke or in a scene, is
often where the comedy happens, 

136
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,417
or where the satire happens.
And so,

137
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:23,418
he's a fool because he doesn't
act according to logic, 

138
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,959
and he also doesn't act
according to social norms, 

139
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:30,329
and he doesn't act according to
social expectations, 

140
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,459
or expectations of what a human
reaction would be.

141
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,301
It's funny to talk about this
with a priest, 

142
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,236
because when I would have
people on the show,

143
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,305
who I'd met, men of the cloth,
of any faith, 

144
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:43,142
or people who I knew were of a-
of at least a 

145
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:45,878
deep or overt faith, if that was
part of their public persona 

146
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,614
that we knew about them,
I would- I would

147
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:52,551
often go back to talk to them,
and instead of saying, you know,

148
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,153
he's a well-intentioned,
poorly informed,

149
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:57,990
high status idiot, I would say,
"He's a fool." 

150
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:04,397
And though Christ says, "Call no
man fool, I am one." And so-

151
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:06,746
Aren't we all fools for Christ,
huh?

152
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,134
[exhales]

153
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:12,238
Yeah, yeah, willing to be
wrong in society,

154
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,940
or wrong according to our time, 

155
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,076
but right according to
our conscience,

156
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:18,477
which is guided by
the Holy Spirit.

157
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,187
FR. TOM: Now, how long-

158
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,914
COLBERT: Are you writing
this down by the way?

159
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:23,416
Because I'm laying it, this is-

160
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,684
FR. TOM: We're recording- 

161
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,185
COLBERT: I mean, I should have
this in Latin, what I just said.

162
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:28,487
I'm sending all of this to Rome,
right away, so don't worry.

163
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:29,220
COLBERT: Please.

164
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,357
FR. TOM: Tell me something,
for each of those episodes,

165
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,808
and I watched several of them-

166
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,261
All 1,447 I hope.

167
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,095
FR. TOM: Several-

168
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:37,196
COLBERT: Several.

169
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,296
FR. TOM: How long did it take to
prepare one episode?

170
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,301
Like, how many people are
working with you to produce 

171
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:44,401
that character, and that
episode?

172
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,572
Uh, let's see. 

173
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,711
Some shows we wrote in a day,
and that was very hard to do, 

174
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:53,979
'cause to do a half hour show, 

175
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,449
creating it in a single day
would be really hard.

176
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,619
Uh, there are, including crew,
all in, about 90 people 

177
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:02,679
who worked on the last show.

178
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,523
On the next show I'm working on,
there's going to be 

179
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:05,357
nearly 200 people-

180
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,007
For<i> The Late Show-</i>

181
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:08,027
COLBERT: For<i> The Late Show,</i>
on CBS.

182
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:10,308
Um, there's going to be
nearly 200 people:

183
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,631
a dozen writers,

184
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:15,801
another handful, four or five
people who are 

185
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,470
producers and also writers, 

186
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,739
in other words they're part of
an editorial staff that is 

187
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:24,577
cutting, collating, punching up
scripts, polishing them, 

188
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:26,148
getting them to that final form
so that I can say to them,

189
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,749
I'm one of those people.
Um, we have-

190
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:35,454
I have producers who are, we say
in our booking department, 

191
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:39,425
in our guest department, who- 

192
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,293
work with me as to what
sort of people

193
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,529
I would want to talk to, um, 

194
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,898
Emily Lazar, who is my
co-executive producer, 

195
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,167
I've worked with her for years,
she knows the kind of people 

196
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:49,137
who interest me.

197
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,805
Um, hopefully people who
represent something, or an idea,

198
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:57,943
aren't merely famous.
Um- and we have

199
00:07:57,976 --> 00:07:59,879
a production department
that is actually doing

200
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,548
the nuts and bolts, literally
paying the bills, hiring

201
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:08,120
the caterers, feeding everybody,
keeping the lights on, 

202
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,122
making sure it gets broadcast.

203
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:12,224
We have the crew shooting
the camera,

204
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:14,860
you have the people in
the control shooting the-

205
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:15,994
we have the cameramen
shooting the show,

206
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,531
you got people in the control
room doing the sound, 

207
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,533
sequencing all the graphics,
all the video,

208
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,334
you've got a graphics
department creating

209
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,469
what you see over my shoulder, 

210
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:24,970
or the graphics on
the lower screen,

211
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:27,006
or the editors creating
the roll-in films

212
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,175
that we do on the show. Um-

213
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,611
I envy, I covet my
neighbour here.

214
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:37,283
Yeah. But it's a- you know,
it's a whole lot people,

215
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:42,655
hopefully pulling on the same
rope, and-

216
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,456
And the really nice thing about
doing it every day 

217
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:47,693
is that you do your best to
get it right, but-

218
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:50,743
you know, it's like Kleenex,
there's another one in the box, 

219
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,731
and you'll get it tomorrow.

220
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:55,301
What I found interesting,
there's even a play on words,

221
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,170
of the show. Now, as a teacher
of French,

222
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:01,106
I would say,<i> "C'est le Rapport
 du Monsieur Colbert."</i>

223
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,341
<i> Mais oui.</i>

224
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:05,010
FR. TOM: And you called it
the Colbert<i> "Rapport",</i>

225
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:08,180
it wasn't<i> The Colbert Report,</i>
but<i> "Rapport".</i> And- 

226
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:09,815
what was behind all that?

227
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,450
COLBERT: Well first of all, we
thought it would sound

228
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,718
more pretentious.

229
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,420
[Fr. Tom laughing]

230
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,021
So you can- it'll play
in Quebec.

231
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:17,156
My character's high status
remember,

232
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,424
my character that I played
at the old show

233
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,993
was really high status, and so,
we thought what would be 

234
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:25,030
more pretentious than to A) Have
a pretentious name 

235
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:27,232
like "Colbert", where you don't
pronounce the "T", 

236
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,501
especially to an American ear,
I don't know about a-

237
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:31,503
a Canadian ear, but to
an American ear,

238
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,739
anything that sounds French
is a little, you know,

239
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:38,110
is a little snooty, a little
frou-frou. And so, um-

240
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,846
But I'm Colbert, I was born
Colbert, my father's a Colbert, 

241
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,147
my brothers and sisters
are Colbert,

242
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:43,987
I'm one of 11 kids and half of
us are Colbert 

243
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:46,051
and half of us are Colbert,
because my father said, 

244
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:49,221
"You can choose what you want."
So, I chose Colbert,

245
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,490
because I'm essentially
a pretentious person,

246
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,590
and- so we thought, "Well let's-
how can we increase 

247
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,228
that pretentiousness?
Well let's make it-

248
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:59,832
let's make the word after me,
'Report', to say 'Rapport',"

249
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,767
and- you know, and
Bob's your uncle,

250
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:02,577
that's how we got the name of
the show, but it also is 

251
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,838
a play on words,
because as a pundit,

252
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,607
you know the people I was
modeling myself on, 

253
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:10,567
their relationship to their
audience is sort of like, 

254
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:13,245
you know, "You watch my show,
therefore, you know, 

255
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,381
you're the heroes, you get
what's going on in the world, 

256
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,750
because I'm telling you what's
going on in the world, and 

257
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,952
together we're going
to fix things."

258
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:23,589
And that attitude of like, you-
we, we're the it-getters, 

259
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:26,358
that sense of rapport was just
another play on words 

260
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,560
on the title of the show,
not a great play on words.

261
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:31,997
FR. TOM: How difficult was it
over a period of nine years to 

262
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:34,050
maintain that character,
to stay in character?

263
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,502
COLBERT: Oh, most difficult
actually when I was

264
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,622
talking to guests whose subjects
I was really interested in,

265
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,975
because he- he's
willfully ignorant,

266
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:43,976
he's not just ignorant,

267
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:47,146
he's willfully ignorant because
he knows that 

268
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,183
willful ignorance
allows you to win

269
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:53,385
arguments you otherwise wouldn't
because you can be 

270
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:55,521
selective about your own facts,
and still be 

271
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,022
honest with yourself.

272
00:10:57,055 --> 00:11:01,326
If I choose not to learn what
things are like in reality, 

273
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:06,231
I can say, trickle-down
economics works, 

274
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:08,500
because it feels like
it would, right?

275
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,402
You know, if you just fill
my bucket enough,

276
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:12,237
eventually it's going to
dribble on you,

277
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:14,074
you're welcome, you're welcome
for that dribble, 

278
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:17,780
there's more to come. Um- but

279
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,545
it would help if I don't
actually find out 

280
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,675
what life is like for the poor,
would help if I don't find out 

281
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,484
what the history of trickle-down
economics is, 

282
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:27,986
and that willful ignorance
allows me to win 

283
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,066
that argument honestly, because
I just don't know otherwise.

284
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:33,125
He's not malicious, he was
well-intentioned.

285
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:37,629
And it was hardest to maintain
that sense of ignorance, 

286
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:40,499
or to maintain that foolish
behaviour, 

287
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,801
in the face of people whose
subject I really enjoyed, 

288
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:46,672
like my friend Neil deGrasse
Tyson, um-

289
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:50,709
Fr. Jim Martin, um- 

290
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:56,348
because if I really liked their
subject, it would be hard to- 

291
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,684
it would be hard to maintain my-

292
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:02,554
my game of embodying
common ignorances,

293
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:06,625
because I wanted to engage them
on their subject 

294
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:11,864
in an honest and passionate way,
but that wasn't my job. 

295
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,900
My job was actually to really
allow them to dispel 

296
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:18,437
common ignorances about their
subject by- by being-

297
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,318
by standing them up,
for my guests,

298
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,009
so they can knock them down, 

299
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:26,178
and the only time I was
frustrated by that, really, 

300
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:30,115
is when my guest wouldn't
realize I was doing it.

301
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:31,183
[Fr. Tom laughing]

302
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:32,818
And they would let me win,
I didn't want to win,

303
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,419
I wanted my guest to win,

304
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,755
but sometimes, I guess the force
of the personality 

305
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:39,625
of the character I was playing
would steamroll them, so-

306
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,160
I'm sorry, it's over now.

307
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:46,198
[applause and cheering]

308
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:48,267
Folks, the 2016
Presidential election

309
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:50,439
is almost upon us, and I for one
cannot wait to see 

310
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,907
who the American people elect
next for John Boehner to sue.

311
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:55,329
[audience laughing]

312
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,410
Of course, former First Lady,
former Senator, 

313
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:00,520
and former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton is 

314
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:03,715
the current frontrunner,
which is surprising

315
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:06,251
since it sounds like she can't
hold down a job.

316
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:07,352
[audience laughing]

317
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,402
FR. TOM: You had a great
political satire 

318
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,090
that was going on, your
commentary on politics, 

319
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:13,959
your commentary on the
American government,

320
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:16,261
on politicians. 

321
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:18,530
Are there limits to
political satire,

322
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:20,299
are there limits to-

323
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,100
Oh, yeah sure, I mean it
depends on what you mean

324
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,769
the goal of political satire is.

325
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,237
Well what is the goal?
In your mind, 

326
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:26,762
what was the goal of
political satire?

327
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,807
COLBERT: To make people laugh.

328
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:30,887
You know, I would make jokes
about politics because 

329
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,733
my model was the news, and
I care about politics,

330
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,782
and I care about- I care about
current events, 

331
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,283
and I'll always do jokes
about that,

332
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:41,153
I mean the new show has that
as well, we're definitely-

333
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:42,454
that's a big part of
the new show,

334
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:46,491
especially going into a
Presidential election. But- 

335
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:48,827
the goal is to make people
laugh, I mean 

336
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:49,955
politics is incredibly
frustrating, the news can be 

337
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:52,397
incredibly depressing, if we
just make your day 

338
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:57,716
a little bit better, you know,
at the end because we- 

339
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:01,153
we make jokes that shows, yeah
we feel the same way you do, 

340
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:03,842
or like, or rather we curate
for you our feelings

341
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:08,213
about the news, and maybe you
agree with our jokes 

342
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:10,082
or what's funny about
the day's news.

343
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,384
That sense of connection between

344
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:14,820
the performer and the audience
is the entire intention, 

345
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,257
you know, why does anybody-
why does anybody-

346
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,964
what does anybody want?
Not to be alone,

347
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,761
and I think a performer gets
onstage and says the things

348
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:25,530
that are in his mind, in his
own particular way,

349
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,666
to make a connection
with an audience

350
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,968
so he doesn't feel so alone.

351
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:34,139
And hopefully the audience feels
the same way, you know,

352
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,241
it's not conscious,
it's not conscious,

353
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:39,778
it's here, it's not here. And- 

354
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,079
so that's got to be the goal, 

355
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:43,189
that connection has got to be
the goal, and the- 

356
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:45,992
making somebody laugh has
got to be the goal.

357
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:50,389
You can't think
that your- your

358
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,524
satire is going to
change things.

359
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,093
Peter Cook famously said,
great satirist,

360
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:59,231
worked with Dudley Moore,
and uh-

361
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:04,670
in<i> Beyond the Fringe,</i>
he famously said that

362
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,307
the greatest satire of the 20th
Century was the Weimar cabaret, 

363
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:11,871
and boy they just stopped Hitler
in their tracks.

364
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,790
You know- you know,
you can't imagine that

365
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:17,015
however great your joke is
that it's gonna

366
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:21,954
change things, what it does is-
just make a connection 

367
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,022
with an audience who's feeling
the same way you do.

368
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:25,924
FR. TOM: You had a great way of
talking about religion 

369
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,726
as well, about- you're Catholic,

370
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,127
everybody knows you're Catholic,

371
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:31,152
you were able to make fun
of the Catholic Church,

372
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,764
I mean I watched some
of those episodes

373
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,733
and just burst out laughing,
and you got away with it!

374
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,201
I'm so glad.

375
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:38,870
FR. TOM: And at times I heard
you say some comments about-

376
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:42,240
COLBERT: I would sometimes
scoot around my priest,

377
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,876
at the end of Mass,
I was kind of like-

378
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:49,181
"Hi Father!" I'd just leave.
They were very nice about it.

379
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,350
But you had a way of doing it
where you didn't-

380
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,410
you didn't cross a line, but you
made us laugh at ourselves, 

381
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:56,054
and not to take ourselves
too seriously.

382
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,423
Well that would be nice, I hope
so, I mean I hope so.

383
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,658
I didn't want to- you know,

384
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:02,127
I didn't want to make-
I don't ever,

385
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,484
I mean I'll still make jokes
about the Church, 

386
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,364
I'll make jokes about anything,
you can't make- 

387
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,899
you can't- as long as you're not
being malicious, 

388
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,335
I don't think you can leave
anything off the table.

389
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:15,841
I- I wouldn't want to
make jokes-

390
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,143
it wouldn't feel right for me,
it wouldn't feel good for me, 

391
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:21,079
it wouldn't be obeying my own
conscience, I suppose, 

392
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:23,749
to make jokes about
the sacraments,

393
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,418
or specifically the Eucharist, I
mean the other sacraments,

394
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,186
for some reason don't feel as- 

395
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:32,257
well they're not Christ himself,
but um- so, like- 

396
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:35,066
like a nacho cheese Eucharist
joke- not-

397
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:36,928
FR. TOM: You wouldn't
go there, good.

398
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,988
You know, like- you know,
there's plenty in that realm

399
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,365
that I don't want to do
that joke-

400
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:41,400
FR. TOM: Don't go to church
that Sunday.

401
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,869
COLBERT: Yeah, exactly.
Um, but- 

402
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,270
I mean, the Church is an
important part of my life, 

403
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:47,639
I would be crazy if I didn't
make jokes about it.

404
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:51,109
But one thing my character had,
and I had in common, 

405
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:53,779
is that, yeah, we both
are Catholics, and

406
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:58,083
he just feels like a victim
about it, all the time.

407
00:16:58,116 --> 00:16:59,418
FR. TOM: And you wore it
on your sleeve,

408
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,585
you were happy to do so.

409
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:02,220
Yeah, happy to, yeah.

410
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:06,024
FR. TOM: What did you think, as
a major figure in television-

411
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:06,992
COLBERT: Yeah.

412
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:07,926
FR. TOM: When-

413
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:08,063
COLBERT: The major
figure in television- 

414
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,962
The- excuse me, "the",
I forgot the article,

415
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:14,499
when you saw the terrible things
happen in Paris, 

416
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:15,801
with Charlie Hebdo-

417
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,402
Oh my God, I was-

418
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,204
FR. TOM: What was going on
inside of you, because

419
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:21,406
in a sense, you were
able to show us

420
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,376
that if we love our religion,
we're able to laugh at it,

421
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,678
and then we saw the tragedy
happen in Paris,

422
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:28,748
and<i> "Je suis Charlie",</i>
and everything else,

423
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,782
what did you think?

424
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:34,186
Well first of all,

425
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,266
shocked and horrified that this
would happen to people 

426
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:42,060
for any- any public expression,
regardless of 

427
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,196
how anyone might be
offended by it.

428
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,166
Shocking and horrific, and- 

429
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:52,904
really struck on- there's
no sufficient-

430
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,034
there's no sufficient response
I could've thought of

431
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:59,399
at that moment, and I felt very
lucky not to be on-air 

432
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:04,850
at that time, to- to have to- 

433
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,385
often when a big story happens,
I would think, 

434
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:09,287
"I wish I were on-air to talk
about this," that one was like, 

435
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:10,868
"I'm so glad I'm not because I
don't have anything 

436
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:14,092
I think that approaches-
approaches it." Because also, 

437
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,462
you know, finding humour in
the tragedy of horror,

438
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:21,299
of others, is you know- not
my job. Matter of fact,

439
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:24,703
it's actually part of my job
to have the-

440
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,841
discretion not to do that, 

441
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:33,111
to know when not to do that. Um-

442
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:35,447
so that was my first reaction
was, it was kind of 

443
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,550
a selfish one, which was,
"I'm so glad

444
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:42,187
I don't have to be on-air right
now." Um- but-

445
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:44,258
the second reaction was,
you know,

446
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:46,758
if this were the 14th Century,

447
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:51,530
Christians could have done this.

448
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,765
If the 15th Century Christians
might have been offended 

449
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,769
to the point of violence,
at blaspheme.

450
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:02,774
You know, check your history
books. So, in an ultimate sense,

451
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:06,511
I do not perceive- I don't
perceive that- 

452
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:12,617
that action, as indicative of
Islam, but- 

453
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:15,269
so I'm not trying to make a
moral equivalency between 

454
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,894
the Christianity of the Middle
Ages and these people, 

455
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,702
who are doing this horror
right now, but

456
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:25,864
every religion has

457
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:28,133
been so defensive of its beliefs

458
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,069
that it has actually abandoned
its beliefs at times.

459
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:36,007
And- 

460
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:39,542
that we now, that I could do my
show and make jokes, 

461
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,480
about the Church, and now
sit with a priest

462
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:46,685
and laugh about it, that's a
fairly modern behaviour.

463
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,719
It's a form of-

464
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:48,987
COLBERT: That's not a
hundred year-old,

465
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,471
that's not a hundred year old
behaviour, 

466
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:54,526
this is a modern behaviour,
this is- I hope,

467
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,163
the right relationship to have
with your faith, 

468
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:01,433
which is to love it, but not
to exclude it from

469
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,635
your intellect.

470
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:06,004
It's also a form of maturity
too, in faith.

471
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,639
COLBERT: I hope so.

472
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,507
FR. TOM: That people who believe
can be mature enough 

473
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:12,325
that you love something so much,
that you're able to also 

474
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,746
make light of some things.

475
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,250
COLBERT: Uh, Carl Sagan
once said that, 

476
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,852
"Buddhists believe their God
is so great

477
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:22,954
that he need not
actually exist."

478
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,256
[Fr. Tom laughing]

479
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,316
COLBERT: Which I think
is a- which is a really- 

480
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:31,896
I really like that because
it reminds me of

481
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,232
St. Anselm of Canterbury's
ontological argument 

482
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,301
for the existence of God,
about, you know,

483
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,570
"The fool says in his heart that
there is no God, 

484
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,872
but by God, he means that being
then which no greater being 

485
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,208
can be conceived." And then it
goes into this lovely 

486
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,944
13-step proof that God
must exist because

487
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:49,114
we conceive of the Word.
It's logically perfect,

488
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,383
it's completely unsatisfying.

489
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:59,057
Faith ultimately can't be
argued, faith has to be felt.

490
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:04,281
And hopefully you can still feel
your faith fully, 

491
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:09,801
and let your mind have a logical
life of its own, 

492
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:14,906
and they do not defy each other,
but complement each other, 

493
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:20,983
because logic itself, I don't
think, for me, and you know- 

494
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:23,915
Aquinas might say differently. 

495
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,551
Logic itself will not
lead me to God.

496
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:31,456
But my love of the world, and my
gratitude toward it, will.

497
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:36,261
And, so, hopefully I can use my
mind to make my jokes, 

498
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:39,301
and not deny my love for God
at the same time.

499
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:41,232
FR. TOM: Let me ask you a
question, the founder of

500
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:43,968
your Church and the founder of
my Church, this Palestinian Jew

501
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:45,770
of the 1st Century named Jesus-

502
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:46,871
Yeah.

503
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:48,640
FR. TOM: When I- I
teach Scripture,

504
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:51,776
I know a lot about Jesus and
what he's done, but one thing 

505
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,678
I don't find in the
New Testament

506
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:55,847
is that Jesus laughed, he told-

507
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:56,924
COLBERT: No! It did say
Jesus wept,

508
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,783
that's tough for a comedian.

509
00:21:58,816 --> 00:21:59,851
FR. TOM: It's the shortest line.

510
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:02,787
COLBERT: Nowhere does it
say that Jesus, you know-

511
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:02,850
He laughed-

512
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:04,856
COLBERT: Guffawed. 

513
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:07,392
FR. TOM: Yeah he sat around- I
can't imagine him sitting around

514
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:09,427
the Sea of Galilee, with fish
and some drinks-

515
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:09,981
COLBERT: No, uh-uh.

516
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,364
FR. TOM: -with a bunch of his
motley crew-

517
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,598
But he had to, right?

518
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:14,799
Yeah, how can he not?

519
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:16,869
COLBERT: He's fully man right?
Fully God, fully man?

520
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,970
But it doesn't say that
he laughed or smiled, 

521
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:19,904
do you believe that?

522
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,239
COLBERT: No, but- but wait
a second. No,

523
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:23,339
nowhere does it say,
"Jesus busted a gut."

524
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,276
[Fr. Tom laughing]

525
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:27,278
COLBERT: Judas, it does say
Judas busted a gut!

526
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,012
FR. TOM: It certainly did.

527
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,547
COLBERT: That's, yeah.

528
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:32,062
Um- but, here's where
I think Jesus

529
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,718
had to have been laughing.

530
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:34,652
Where?

531
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:35,387
Or at least smiling-

532
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,210
Where?

533
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:40,525
COLBERT: Is, uh- were they off
of Capernaum or something,

534
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,796
'cause it's Peter- Capernaum
is Peter's hometown right?

535
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:47,832
So, Sea of Galilee,
there's a storm,

536
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:51,302
the fishermen are out there,
Peter- 

537
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:52,404
his brother's Andrew, is that
what it is?

538
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,505
Yeah, yeah.

539
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,740
COLBERT: Anyways, out there
with the other Apostles,

540
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,175
or just other fishermen, storm,
they don't know what to do,

541
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:00,245
they see Jesus walking across
the water toward them, 

542
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,482
calming the waves around him as
he goes, and Peter, you know, 

543
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:06,351
he does his best-

544
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,419
[Colbert chuckles] 

545
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,220
And he thinks- he takes a risk,

546
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:14,359
he goes, "Well- if I believe,
I can do that too."

547
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,429
So he throws a leg over, goes to
walk across the water, 

548
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:21,266
and he does it for a little bit.
But then he looks down, 

549
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,501
loses faith and drops,
and I just-

550
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:27,605
I have to imagine that that
looked like Wile E. Coyote 

551
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:30,809
running too far off a cliff,
and then- going about

552
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,343
40 feet off from the cliff
and then going-

553
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,112
[imitates Wile E. Coyote
falling]

554
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:35,914
And falling down
into the canyon.

555
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:40,485
If Jesus didn't laugh then,
then I'm in big trouble,

556
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:42,253
because that's the God
I worship.

557
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:44,589
FR. TOM: You know, one of the-
good. One of the scenes- 

558
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,057
'cause I look at this and-

559
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,096
COLBERT: 'Cause when he
comes over and he says, "Oh-"

560
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:51,896
I'm paraphrasing,
can I paraphrase?

561
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:53,765
It's the 21st Century, no one's
going to burn me-

562
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:54,899
FR. TOM: You're allowed to
with me.

563
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,568
COLBERT: I'm going to
paraphrase the Gospel right now,

564
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,658
mistranslating it, basically it
says, "Why'd you look down? 

565
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:03,508
Oh you of little faith. Just
keep your eyes on me," 

566
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,109
because when he had
his eyes on Christ,

567
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,511
all things were possible, 

568
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:09,380
but when he looked at the actual
trouble, he fell.

569
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:10,815
FR. TOM: You know another time
I think he laughed,

570
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:12,183
'cause I've had to go through
the New Testament, 

571
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:13,718
people have said, "He never
smiled, he didn't laugh, 

572
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,453
don't make him into that."

573
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:18,513
When he got to Jericho, he's
walking along the big crowd, 

574
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,825
and there's this guy climbing up
a tree, 

575
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:22,193
hanging out of a tree.

576
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:24,429
Can you imagine Jesus standing
at the bottom of that tree,

577
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,509
"Zacchaeus, what in God's name
are you doing? Get down here.

578
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:29,968
I'm coming to your house for a
blast tonight," you know?

579
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,302
And they said, "No, no,
he didn't laugh,

580
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:33,771
he was reprimanding him."
I said, "Jesus laughed,

581
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:37,075
he smiled." Humour is a
really important thing.

582
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,510
Sure, sure.

583
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,879
Now we've talked before
about humour, 

584
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,147
and I want you to tell me
a little bit,

585
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:44,654
what's your understanding
of humour?

586
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,876
Why is humour important for
the human condition?

587
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:50,288
We got a lot of people walking
around the world today saying,

588
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:52,390
"The world is bad, the Church is
bad, everything is bad, 

589
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:53,958
we're going to hell
in a hand basket."

590
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:56,494
What's your role in humour?

591
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:58,614
Well on one level, humour's
a release valve,

592
00:24:59,043 --> 00:25:02,847
of tension. You know, the world
doesn't make sense 

593
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,070
to us sometimes, and the
incongruity of jokes  

594
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:08,180
actually is like a release: you
reproduce the incongruity

595
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,973
you see in the life that you
wish was happening but isn't,

596
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:16,347
and you create that incongruity
in a joke, and the-

597
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:19,275
the parallel feeling of those
two makes you laugh, boy, 

598
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:21,468
that was an hilarious
explanation of humour.

599
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:24,022
[Fr. Tom laughing]

600
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,524
COLBERT: But I think the most
important thing is-

601
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:29,060
is it's a communication tool,
it's used to communicate to

602
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:31,180
somebody else about the
incongruities of life.

603
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:35,633
And-

604
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:39,404
C.S. Lewis, whose apologetics
I really enjoy reading

605
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,238
when I was younger especially-

606
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:41,239
FR. TOM: Great guy.

607
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:42,540
COLBERT: He has, in<i>
 The Screwtape Letters,</i>

608
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:46,377
he talks about awe and humour.
And he says that there are 

609
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:49,812
four different types of humour,
and one is- 

610
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:51,583
or four things that
produce laughter,

611
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,623
and it's one devil advising
another devil, 

612
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,387
that's the premise of<i>
 The Screwtape Letters,</i>

613
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,844
for those who haven't read them
out there, they're really- 

614
00:25:58,255 --> 00:25:59,891
they're really great. And, 

615
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:01,991
Screwtape is writing to his
nephew Wormwood, 

616
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,063
who is a demon in training,
about how to get the clients, 

617
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,183
which is us, to their
infernal father,

618
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,001
and away from the clutches of
the enemy, who is God.

619
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:13,271
And so he says, "Now listen,
I understand your patient,

620
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:15,673
your client is laughing a lot. 

621
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:17,709
This won't necessarily help us,
you see. 

622
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,829
We think that this will help us,
but there are many things 

623
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,948
that produce laughter,
one is joy," and he goes,

624
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:26,068
"Joy might be the laughter
produced by old friends,

625
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:29,387
or family, who haven't seen
each other in a long time.

626
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:32,379
This is related to play.
These things

627
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:38,133
are a music that we can't hear,
and- 

628
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:43,101
but is played by the enemy,"
that brings joy 

629
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,836
to these peoples' lives.

630
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,673
The second one is, um- 

631
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:51,009
the second one is play, that's
the second one, play,

632
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,045
like the laughter that's
produced by doing something 

633
00:26:54,078 --> 00:26:56,814
in common together, and perhaps
doing it well, 

634
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:58,816
or a game of some kind.

635
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:00,685
The third one is
the joke proper,

636
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:03,021
which of course is the one that
concerns me as a humourist.

637
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:09,093
The joke proper um, can, um- 

638
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:11,223
can be about things
that are virtuous,

639
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:18,153
but the joke proper itself is
not necessarily a sin, 

640
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:21,806
because even making a joke
about virtue

641
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,677
takes intellectual sweat, which
is itself a gift from God 

642
00:27:25,071 --> 00:27:26,739
that people are using.

643
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,347
The thing that produces humour,
or the thing that 

644
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:34,010
produces laughter that will help
the Devil, is flippancy. 

645
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:37,789
In flippancy, no joke is
actually made.

646
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,991
The attitude that a joke
has been made

647
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:41,926
is copped by everybody there.

648
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:45,263
It does not increase affection,
it distances people, 

649
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:50,702
it armours the soul against joy,
and it deadens the intellect-

650
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,752
This is a philosophy course,
this is great!

651
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,507
COLBERT: Well, it's a great
article, and if, you know,

652
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:59,658
if someone is interested in- 

653
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:02,234
in religion, or Christian life, 

654
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:04,714
and interested in humour at the
same time, read that essay 

655
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:09,654
because it's a great guide post,
it's very easy 

656
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,923
to pretend like you're making
a joke with people

657
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,293
who also want to pretend
they're making jokes,

658
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,333
and if you're flippant,
that is the-

659
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:22,967
it is the opposite of joy. And- 

660
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,206
you know, here's a- here's
a purpose of humour,

661
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:33,077
or of laughter really, because
humour's a soft term,

662
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,982
I've said this before, but 

663
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:40,251
you can't laugh and be afraid
at the same time,

664
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,553
and I don't mean that, like
mentally you can't hold

665
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:44,989
both things, it's somehow
like autonomic.

666
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,325
It's somehow physical. I think
that's one of the reasons 

667
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,794
why I'll be like, we laugh when
we're afraid, 

668
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:52,830
our body's trying to get rid of
that feeling inside of us, 

669
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:57,568
but if you're laughing,
you know, you-

670
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,688
you just won't be afraid, which
is why it is so important 

671
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:02,601
to laugh at the Devil. You know,
I forgot who said it, 

672
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:06,010
it might've been Milton who
says, "You must laugh

673
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:09,781
at the Devil because by mockery
alone he cannot abide."

674
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,415
FR. TOM: You know, I always say
that several years ago, 

675
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:13,951
a certain President of the
United States went to Iraq 

676
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:16,687
looking for the weapons of
mass destruction,

677
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:20,210
and didn't find them. We have
the gift of mass construction, 

678
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,918
it's called joy, it's a
dangerous weapon. 

679
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,230
And sometimes against
the most horrific things

680
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,350
that have happened in our lives,
and the world, 

681
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,602
the best thing that can happen
sometimes is laughter, 

682
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:33,662
and a smile, and joy. It's-

683
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,573
Joy is super important.

684
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:38,633
We, at the old show, and
hopefully the new show, 

685
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:42,780
you know, we're just starting
up, we used to call it 

686
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:44,015
"The Joy Machine"-

687
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,149
[Fr. Tom laughing]

688
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:49,020
COLBERT: -because, especially
when it was really hard,

689
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,555
like on those days that,
you know,

690
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,724
doing a show all year round
because we do- 

691
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:56,694
we do 200 shows a year, and 

692
00:29:56,727 --> 00:29:58,529
it's really hard to do that,
but you don't want to

693
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:00,649
bank down your ambitions, so
you'll do a really hard show, 

694
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:05,369
in a really hard schedule, and
somehow when it was hardest, 

695
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:07,071
it would often feel
the most joyful,

696
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,121
or often does feel
the most joyful. And-

697
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,743
and that's when I would sort of
jokingly call it 

698
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:14,979
"The Joy Machine", but it's
sort of true because

699
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:17,114
the only way to approach
something that's really hard, 

700
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:19,234
it's got to be with joy, because
if you don't approach it

701
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:23,843
with joy, it's just a machine,
and it'll grind you up,

702
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:28,359
and the lesson that I took from
that is that

703
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:32,230
doing something joyfully doesn't
make it any easier, 

704
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,340
it only makes it better. And
also, it makes it communal, 

705
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:37,735
that we're all doing it
together. 

706
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:40,404
When you work in fear, or when
you work in, you know, 

707
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:42,540
in distress, you often
feel alone,

708
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:45,109
but jokes, laughter,
humour, joy,

709
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:47,445
whatever you want to call it,
it connects people

710
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,495
and, as I said earlier, what do
we want to be? Not alone.

711
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:52,083
Speaking of "The Joy Machine",

712
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,153
we got this guy running our
Church right now, Pope Francis-

713
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,520
I'm familiar.

714
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,889
FR. TOM: You've seen him,
you kind of saw him

715
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:58,923
in pictures and stuff?

716
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:00,491
Sure, sure, I get<i> US Magazine.</i>

717
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:03,461
[laughing]

718
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,930
FR. TOM: He writes his first
Apostolic letter called 

719
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:07,765
<i> Evangelii Gaudium-</i>

720
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:09,233
COLBERT: Sure, I took my Latin,
yeah.

721
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:10,234
FR. TOM: It doesn't mean-

722
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:11,502
The message of joy-

723
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:13,582
FR. TOM:<i> The Gospel of Joy,</i>
yeah.

724
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,742
What do you think about Pope
Francis? Where does his- 

725
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,110
I think he's pretty joyful,
where do you think

726
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,045
it comes from?

727
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:22,313
Oh I don't know,

728
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:24,615
I don't presume to know exactly,
but I-

729
00:31:24,648 --> 00:31:25,749
FR. TOM: What do you think?

730
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:31,355
Well I assume that it is a gift
of the Holy Spirit. Um-

731
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:35,860
you know, my favourite- and I've
said this to your friend,

732
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,920
Jim Martin, is that my favourite
passage from the Gospel is, 

733
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:41,632
"So I say to you do not worry,
for whom among you by worrying 

734
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:42,900
could change a hair on his head,
or add a cubit 

735
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:47,405
to the span of his life," that
sort of thing. Um- and- 

736
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:52,476
the opposite of worry is joy,
you know, the opposite of 

737
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:57,982
fear, or anger, is peace, the
opposite of fear would be 

738
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:04,039
laughter. Um, so I assume that 

739
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:07,625
he takes the Gospel to heart,
and does not worry.

740
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:13,464
When people are angry I think
mostly they're afraid. And, 

741
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:17,034
if you take that particular
passage, which is my favourite, 

742
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,403
it's from the sermon, when you
can't go wrong in the sermon, 

743
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:21,739
it's all hits. It's like
The Beatles,

744
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:23,207
it's The Beatles of the Bible.

745
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,493
FR. TOM: Like, like, like, like-

746
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,759
Exactly, just check everybody
off, swipe-

747
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,914
which one's Tinder? Swipe right?

748
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:31,649
I swipe right on all that stuff.

749
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:34,919
So if you take that line
of the Gospel to heart,

750
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:37,188
I mean it's hard, you know,
it's hard,

751
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,308
then I think, you've got a much
better chance 

752
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,859
of living in joy, because you
live in acceptance, 

753
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:43,828
you're not afraid of what's
going to happen to you.

754
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:48,366
You know, and what I like about
it is that Christ doesn't say, 

755
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,436
"Try not to worry." He says, "Do
not- so I say to you," comma, 

756
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:54,772
or colon, however they would do
it in Aramaic-

757
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,273
[laughing]

758
00:32:56,306 --> 00:33:00,378
COLBERT: "Do not worry,"
it's close to a commandment. 

759
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:06,150
And given such hope by this
pope, "Pope hope", 

760
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:09,620
because that's the Church that
I want, that's-

761
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:12,790
when he said in his opening-
when he said in his- 

762
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:15,760
I think it was, was it the first
sermon that he gave? 

763
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:20,297
After being made pope in the-
that papal audience room, 

764
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:23,370
where he said, "I want this to
be a Church- 

765
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:24,376
a poor Church for the poor."

766
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:26,370
FR. TOM:<i> "Una chiesa dei poveri:</i>

767
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:28,339
I want a Church for the poor,
a Church of the poor."

768
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:30,307
Now you're just bragging
that you can speak Italian.

769
00:33:30,034 --> 00:33:31,837
[laughing]

770
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,344
FR. TOM: I was there!
I was there!

771
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:35,246
COLBERT:<i> Padre, uno italiano
 e morto cavi,</i>

772
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,014
<i> to ma voglio parlare meglio.</i>

773
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:37,915
[Fr. Tom laughing]

774
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:38,682
<i> Bravo?</i>

775
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:39,750
FR. TOM:<i> Bravissimo. </i>

776
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:41,218
I don't have to translate this
part into Italian.

777
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:43,454
COLBERT:<i> Mille grazie,
 mille grazie padre.</i>

778
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:47,992
Um, that gave- that made me
so excited!

779
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,827
I think, you know, one of
the reasons why-

780
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:51,163
and listen, I'm a wealthy man,
don't get me wrong, 

781
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,999
but one of the reasons why we
don't help the poor, 

782
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:56,600
I think is that we think if
we give it to them,

783
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,436
we won't have anything,
you know,

784
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,496
so again it's fear that keeps
you from experiencing the joy 

785
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:05,376
of helping other people. So,
I really like this pope,

786
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:09,947
you know, I'm gonna- I'm gonna-
you know, 

787
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:12,125
I like this pope because
it seems like-

788
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:15,186
I believe the Church has always
had a message of love, 

789
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,420
it's not like I'm somebody like,

790
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,856
"The Church is different now!"
I love my Church, you know,

791
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,258
it's not like I don't have-
I don't share-

792
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,328
You love it, you're in church,
you teach CCD-

793
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,530
COLBERT: Now listen, let's not
go overboard with that stuff.

794
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:28,640
I go to church, you know,
I do go to church,

795
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:32,603
and I have taught CCD, you know,
I taught three years of it 

796
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:35,473
over the last nine years,
not every year, um,

797
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,908
but I am no particular exemplar
of my faith, 

798
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:43,814
I just happen to have affection
for my Church, and I love, um- 

799
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:48,219
the opportunity, the traditions
that my Church give me 

800
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,987
to contemplate the message
of Christ,

801
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:51,604
and that's a complicated way
of saying it, but that's-

802
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,756
FR. TOM: No, I got it.

803
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,947
COLBERT: -that's- like the
action of the Mass itself

804
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:56,627
I enjoy, because I love
the recapitulation

805
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:59,537
of the Last Supper. I really
like it, it actually makes- 

806
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:03,100
it makes the idea of- 

807
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:07,004
the Eucharist, uh- 

808
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:09,306
well the physical action of it
makes the Eucharist 

809
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:12,276
real for me, though I got to
tell you, you know, 

810
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:16,313
and, I don't know, take this
with some salt and light-

811
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:18,549
FR. TOM: Thank you. That's in
the sermon too.

812
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:20,918
COLBERT: Is that when I felt the
Eucharist was most real to me

813
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,320
was a time I didn't receive it.

814
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:26,590
Is that I was actually at an
Anglican Church-

815
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:27,458
FR. TOM: Yeah.

816
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,568
And- uh, you know, no offense,

817
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,396
I was at an Anglican Church and
a female priest 

818
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:35,633
was saying the Mass, and it was
a High Anglican Mass, 

819
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,435
and so the words were
almost exactly

820
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:41,572
the post-Vatican II Liturgy of
the Catholic Church.

821
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:49,246
And when I heard a woman say,
"This is my body," it made the- 

822
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:52,917
it made it- the freshness of
hearing a woman say that 

823
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:57,067
gave the message of universality
that it always should have, 

824
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,858
and I'm not saying it doesn't,
coming out of a male priest, 

825
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:04,295
but it opened my ears to
the possibility that

826
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,032
it is also my body, that- that- 

827
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,112
in my participation in
the Eucharist,

828
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:17,141
I participate in- in the gift
that Christ gives me 

829
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:19,276
in a different way, because I am
not a priest, and the priest 

830
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:21,145
is up there doing his thing,
you know what I mean?

831
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:24,682
He's the big boss up there,
and leading us,

832
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,550
and sharing this experience
with him,

833
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,485
but there is a hierarchical
feeling.

834
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:33,057
To hear a woman say it, who I do
not perceive of as a priest, 

835
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:37,313
do you understand, it also- it
also invited me to perceive 

836
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:41,332
everyone who isn't a priest as
engaging in the sacrament 

837
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,402
in an active way, and
opened my eyes to

838
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:47,775
the message of that moment, of
both the Gospel and the Mass, 

839
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,674
in a way that I hadn't before.

840
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:54,478
And now I invite everyone
to attack me,

841
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:56,780
for suggesting that women
should be priests.

842
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,449
FR. TOM: We will- your address
will be placed 

843
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,517
at the end of this interview,
they can write directly to you.

844
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:01,524
COLBERT: Please do, please.

845
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:03,287
I got a last question for you,
I want to create a-

846
00:37:03,032 --> 00:37:04,233
COLBERT: Really? That's it? I
really killed the interview with

847
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:06,557
that one. Last question,

848
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,196
let's get this guy out of here!
Get him out of here! 

849
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:10,444
FR. TOM: I'm saving the best
for last-

850
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:12,529
[Stephen Colbert laughing]

851
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:13,998
FR. TOM: This is going to be
a long question.

852
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,033
Now, let's create a scenario,
the scenario is-

853
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:18,102
COLBERT: Okay, let's do it-
let's improv.

854
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,237
FR. TOM: Monday morning,
CBS building,

855
00:37:20,027 --> 00:37:23,564
<i> Late Night Show</i> headquarters,
90 people around,

856
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:25,687
your team of writers,
and everybody else-

857
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:27,611
COLBERT: More than that
there, yeah.

858
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,446
And your three principle people,

859
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,248
these three wonderful women
I've been dealing with

860
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:32,216
to get you here-

861
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:33,150
COLBERT: Yes.

862
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:34,351
They come up with the idea
and say,

863
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,120
<i>"Monsieur Colbert,"</i> or whatever
they call you there-

864
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,988
They do call me<i>
 "Monsieur Colbert",</i> yes.

865
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:41,992
FR. TOM: Monsieur Colbert, we
want you to bring Pope Francis 

866
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:44,728
onto this show.

867
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:46,930
Let's create an interview.

868
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:49,050
What would you ask Pope Francis
if he were sitting next to you 

869
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:52,770
on this brand new set that you
just built at CBS, 

870
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:53,771
for the<i> Late Show-</i>

871
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,539
COLBERT: I would ask him
one of the questions 

872
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:59,043
you asked me, which is,
"How do you achieve joy?"

873
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:02,279
'Cause it is- it is a-

874
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:04,548
[exhales]

875
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,450
Well, you know joy and love,

876
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:09,086
joy I think is the expression of
the love at the moment 

877
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,354
that you're in right now, 

878
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:12,089
and the love of the person that
you're with right now.

879
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:15,125
And, uh, 

880
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:19,463
I would ask him about how- how- 

881
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:23,767
how love leads him to joy, or
does love lead him joy.

882
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:25,075
E. E. Cummings said, "Love is
the every only God,

883
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:31,909
who breathed this world so glad
and big." He also said that, 

884
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,044
"Who pays any attention
to the syntax of things

885
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:37,648
will never wholly kiss you,
wholly to be a fool, 

886
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:40,150
my blood approves." And so, 

887
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:42,619
I would ask him about being
a fool for Christ,

888
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:44,729
because many of the things
that the Pope has said

889
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:49,293
have been seen as, I think
probably in some ways, 

890
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:50,861
by people outside of the Church,

891
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:52,796
though I don't know what the
reaction is in- you know, 

892
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:55,833
I'm not a member of the Curia,
as a like- 

893
00:38:55,866 --> 00:39:01,271
sort of bomb-throwing, you know,
but um- 

894
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:04,041
because the syntax, the dogma of
the Church, 

895
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:06,141
is often perceived of as the
syntax of things, 

896
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:10,080
as opposed to be wholly, to be a
fool, my blood approves, 

897
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:13,817
to be a fool for Christ is to
love, because we are made- 

898
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:16,456
we are here to dig our brief
moment in time. 

899
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:21,291
And I would ask him how he puts
that first, because 

900
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:23,193
how do you get to where you are
in the Church 

901
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:27,364
and not to be consumed by
the law, as opposed to

902
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:28,799
the love that led to the law.

903
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:29,900
FR. TOM: What do you think, 

904
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:31,702
what do you think he would
answer you?

905
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:33,837
Just- you've been watching him
now for a couple years, 

906
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:35,124
listening to him and watching
the crowd response, 

907
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,409
what do you think's
underneath all of that?

908
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:41,245
What keeps him from being buried
under something, 

909
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,325
or being burdened by this
wonderful tradition of ours?

910
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:47,117
I don't know, I mean I-

911
00:39:47,015 --> 00:39:50,022
I mean it when I said a gift of
the Holy Spirit, 

912
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:52,790
that doesn't mean something that
you don't have to work for, 

913
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:56,160
I don't think, I think you have
to make a choice to 

914
00:39:56,193 --> 00:40:00,397
perceive Christ in the people
around you, and to 

915
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:03,147
love them without fear, that
anything will be taken from you 

916
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,594
in the gift that you give them
of your own love. Um-

917
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,944
The message of ultimate
sacrifice that Christ shows us 

918
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:16,580
on the cross, um-

919
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,420
He likes people, there's
a simple way-

920
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:24,421
It helps.

921
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:26,156
COLBERT: He likes people,
he's grateful for-

922
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:28,292
maybe he's grateful
for his existence.

923
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,927
I think a lot of people end up
being bitter 

924
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,665
about their own existence,
but to be grateful,

925
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:37,067
even in the face of tragedy, or 

926
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,305
to find a great gift and
bringing comfort to others 

927
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:43,841
also can, I think,
lead you to joy.

928
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,243
But those are all presumptuous
answers, I don't- 

929
00:40:46,276 --> 00:40:47,211
I don't know.

930
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,745
What are some of your
favourite moments? 

931
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:50,855
Do you have one iconic moment,
or one favourite moment 

932
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,550
of Pope Francis? 

933
00:40:53,583 --> 00:41:01,692
I like it when he spends
time with-

934
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,727
um- 

935
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:06,280
developmentally disabled people
in St. Peter's Square.

936
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:10,033
To take the moment to- 

937
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:15,873
give them dignity, of his
attention and respect, is 

938
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:20,477
also very moving to me. Um- 

939
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:24,389
washing the feet of a Muslim
woman on his first Good Friday, 

940
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:26,016
was a very moving moment-

941
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:27,184
Holy Thursday.

942
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:29,319
COLBERT: I'm sorry,
Holy Thursday. Wow.

943
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:30,654
[Fr. Tom laughing]

944
00:41:30,687 --> 00:41:32,322
I gotcha, it's the only thing
I could get you on.

945
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:34,391
COLBERT: Come on, that
was a little hostile Padre.

946
00:41:34,424 --> 00:41:37,361
[laughing]

947
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,796
Let's do this with love. Please.

948
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:40,898
Think of Francis.

949
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:41,899
[laughing]

950
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,369
COLBERT: Um-

951
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,499
I don't know, I like that he's
laughing and smiling a lot, 

952
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:52,276
you know, that's not a moment,
that's an ongoing thing.

953
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,878
When I was younger, I heard
Mother Teresa talk about, 

954
00:41:54,911 --> 00:41:56,179
and I've said this to
Jim Martin too,

955
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:58,279
Mother Teresa talked about,
you know, start your day,

956
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:03,453
smile and say "yes".
Smile and say yes. And,

957
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:08,570
I see that smile, on his face,
and it's inspirational.

958
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:16,400
And- it- 

959
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:21,572
the Church is a flawed and
human institution,

960
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:27,811
for whom I always have hope.
And- 

961
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:33,817
I have no doubt that he's
far from a perfect man,

962
00:42:33,085 --> 00:42:36,522
but he gives me hope that
the message of joy

963
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:40,970
that he wants to spread right
now can be seen as 

964
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,427
not revolutionary,
but a manifestation

965
00:42:43,046 --> 00:42:46,449
of something that was
always there.

966
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:48,943
FR. TOM: I agree. I agree.

967
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:52,035
Stephen Colbert, I can't
thank you enough,

968
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:55,606
this was an incredible insight,
a presentation of 

969
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,608
the new Stephen, the
born again Stephen-

970
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:58,442
[Colbert laughing]

971
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,344
FR. TOM: -and I think,
on one hand,

972
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,981
I'm more in the loss of that
previous guy, but also, 

973
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,683
I think the world is going to
see a new Stephen, 

974
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:08,652
and I think a little bit
of that previous guy

975
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:09,686
might be there too.

976
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:13,056
Oh yeah, I am a hopefully,

977
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:17,094
well-intentioned, poorly
informed, high-status idiot,

978
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,595
I'm not that far away from him.

979
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:19,763
FR. TOM: Welcome to the club.

980
00:43:19,796 --> 00:43:20,797
COLBERT: Thanks!

981
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:21,085
FR. TOM: Thanks for joining us.

982
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,066
COLBERT: Thanks Father.

983
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,235
I have so many memories,

984
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:26,837
mostly shapes and colours.

985

[audience laughing]

986
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,906
There's a fair amount of
drinking along the way.

[audience laughing]

988
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,409
And as I leave you for
the last time,

989
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:34,911
I'd like to share what I've
learned with future generations,

990
00:43:34,944 --> 00:43:38,849
as well as the aliens from
Zaphrax 5 who 

991
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,685
find this show on the golden
cylinders launched into space 

992
00:43:41,718 --> 00:43:43,387
moments before the Earth
explodes.

Hi guys.

995
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,891
But you know what I'll always
remember?

996
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:50,093
The hardworking men and women
of broadcast news,

997
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:53,263
who told us who won that
governor's race.

998
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:54,931
Men and women like 

999
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:56,133
Stephen Colbert.

[audience cheering]

1001
00:43:57,867 --> 00:44:01,104
You see folks, tonight,

1002
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:04,141
tonight marks a sort of farewell
for me, but who knows, 

1003
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,677
someday maybe you'll see me
on TV again, and you'll

1004
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:09,108
nudge your spouse and say,
"Hey, I remember that guy,

1005
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:14,418
I used to love him. Maybe I will
buy his Slap Chop."

[audience laughing]

1007
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:19,056
So, that's it for<i> The Report,</i>

1008
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,891
I'll simply end by saying
it has been

1009
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,927
a pleasure and a privilege to be
welcomed into your homes 

1010
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:24,765
these last nine years.

1011
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:31,168
So to you, and yours, I say
a fond- what's that?

1012
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,370
I have another month and
a half of shows?

[audience laughing]

1014

Well then this was a little
too dramatic!

[audience laughing]

1016

I'm sorry, we'll see you
tomorrow, I'm embarrassed!
