1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:02,300
- Hey, Meghan.
- Hey, boo, what's up?

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,009
- What's up?
So it's--this has been a while.

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,013
You've had the vocal surgery.
- Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:09,669
- So tell everybody exactly--
'cause I don't think everybody

5
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:11,433
knows exactly what happened
to you.

6
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,100
- Oh, okay.

7
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:14,867
Long story.
All right.

8
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:16,300
I was on tour, and
I was on top of the world,

9
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:20,436
and I had everything,
and then I went to rehearsals

10
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:22,737
for another tour I was going on,
the M Train Tour,

11
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,966
and I noticed right away,
it hurt to speak.

12
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:28,400
And I knew, like,
"That can't be good."

13
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:29,637
- Yeah.
- When it hurts to speak.

14
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:31,900
So I tried--
we tried doing rehearsals,

15
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:34,742
and I went to some random doctor
I could find close by,

16
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:38,100
and he saw hemorrhaging,

17
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,010
which is like when your little
tiny vocal cords bleed,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,766
which is not the best,
you know?

19
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,771
So right away,
we had to cancel a week

20
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,633
in the beginning of the tour.

21
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,266
Then we went back on tour.
We were great.

22
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:51,233
I rested--vocal rest
is all you can really do.

23
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,233
And then I just kept
hemorrhaging,

24
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:56,266
'cause I got sick,
I got bronchitis, on tour.

25
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:59,268
So coughing and talking
and singing was all just--

26
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,800
My cords, beating them up.

27
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,241
- So then you--
then you were told,

28
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:05,466
you can either rest for four
months, or have surgery.

29
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,600
- Yeah, I asked my doctor,
I was like,

30
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:08,039
"So, how can
I heal this naturally?"

31
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,640
'Cause surgery is not, like,
what you want to do.

32
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,966
- No.
- So, um...

33
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:13,975
He was like, "Yeah, you could
heal it naturally,

34
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,233
but in like four months,
not talking."

35
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,700
I was like,
"Nobody has that time."

36
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:19,273
Ain't nobody have time for that.
- Nobody has--no.

37
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,968
- No.
- And there was lots of

38
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,171
Instagramming and lots of
texting and stuff?

39
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:25,667
- Yeah. Oh, my phone.

40
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:27,233
The phone is
how I spoke to people.

41
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,200
I had an app that--
text to speech,

42
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:31,435
where you can type in stuff
and speak like a robot.

43
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,635
- Did you meet a boyfriend on
the internet?

44
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,700
- No, no, no, no, no.
No.

45
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:36,940
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yes.

46
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:39,700
- No, I almost--no.

47
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:40,540
- Yes.
- I didn't have a boy--[laughs]

48
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,300
[audience laughter]

49
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:43,869
- I--I didn't have a boyfriend.

50
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,700
- A guy that you were...
interacting with.

51
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:47,007
- There was a guy
that I Instagrammed,

52
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,173
and I didn't put a caption,

53
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:50,000
so the whole world freaked out.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,001
AKA, all my Meghatrons,
all the fans.

55
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:53,004
- Okay.
- They're like, "What is this?"

56
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:54,013
- And? What was it?

57
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:57,008
- And it was just--it was just--
a little thing--nothing.

58
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,010
Nothing. But I did get
a great song out of it.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,009
- I wrote.
- So what's it called?

60
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,018
- Well, it's a new one.
I did it, like, last week.

61
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,074
It's called "Lead Me On."
Oh..,

62
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:07,871
- Oh.
audience: Oh!

63
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,371
- See? It was something.
It wasn't nothing.

64
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:10,874
- This is going the wrong way!
- Yeah.

65
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,100
- This is going the wrong way.
- It's what he gets.

66
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,767
- Sorry.
- He led you on.

67
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:17,700
- Yeah, but he was like--
it's sweet, it's sweet.

68
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,012
I'll play it for you.
- Okay.

69
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:20,935
No, I'm not saying
that it's not sweet.

70
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,134
I'm just saying that
if someone leads you on,

71
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,238
they deserve to have
a song written about them.

72
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:25,736
- It was really sweet.
Like, he said, like,

73
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,766
"I never intended
to lead you on."

74
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:28,772
So that was like the main hook:
It was like,

75
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,700
[singing] "You never
intended to lead me on."

76
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:33,240
But like, come on.
- Yeah.

77
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:34,940
You weren't going to just
read into nothing.

78
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,400
You're not crazy, yeah.
- Yeah.

79
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:38,670
- So he must've led you on.

80
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,068
What's his name?

81
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,733
[audience laughter]

82
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:42,733
[laughter and applause]

83
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:43,740
- I'm so sweaty.
- I know.

84
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:45,438
I'm not going to do that to you.
All right--
